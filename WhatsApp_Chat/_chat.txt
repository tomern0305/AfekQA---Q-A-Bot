[26/04/24, 12:57:47 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: Hi I need one help in react if anyone can help it will be helpful 

I have an instance where 10 pages of the website are linked to the parent webpage and those 10 pages have the same code in the frontend. So rather than coding those pages 10 times I am planning to use  components and props  through react

But the problem is , all the fields inside those pages are user-defined. And later I have to store those user-inputs into my mongo collection. So can you all suggest to me how I can implement this approach?
[26/04/24, 1:06:03 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Campus mantri merch ?

[26/04/24, 3:01:51 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: Usestate feacture of react or is there any fecture in mongo db
[26/04/24, 3:03:01 PM] ~ pulkit: I think managing state with usestate wouldn't be the best approach you can use third state management libs like redux or recoil
[26/04/24, 3:06:57 PM] ~ Revanth: I have done it bro
[26/04/24, 3:11:55 PM] ~ Shreeti Mohapatra: same here 
I think using Redux will be a good option

[26/04/24, 3:30:10 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Currently I learn sorting algos
[26/04/24, 3:43:58 PM] ~ Naresh M: I don't understand the situation clearly, but since you are dealing with mongodb and probably will work with remote state try using react-query, I think using redux here will be making it more complex. As far the front-end try to categories the 10 pages into multiple categories depending on the layout and have a pagelayout where you can dynamically render the pages,

[27/04/24, 4:48:34 PM] Amritaa Sethi Mam Gfg: Hello everyone,

Yes you need to share details with us in case you are having or willing to connect over a meet or something also if you guys want to discuss academic, education, technical stuff you can...just inform us the motto of meeting and who all is participating.

This is basic, you guys are selected to increase the size of coding community and develop a culture.

Therefore for this reason you can connect with each other as and when required.

@919351241669 I appreciate you know the norms and you stand by then.
@919838788826 as communicated on personal chat please connect with me on Monday over a call and we can discuss your project post that anyone who is interested in the same can connect with you.
[27/04/24, 4:52:51 PM] ~ अहं ब्रह्मास्मि-: Yes mam, I will connect on Monday.

[27/04/24, 5:04:18 PM] Amritaa Sethi Mam Gfg: Okay
[27/04/24, 5:04:20 PM] ~ .: if someone wants to create or start GFG student chapter Community  at there college how can they create one ???
[27/04/24, 5:08:59 PM] Amritaa Sethi Mam Gfg: Student Chapter's lead should be from 5th or 6th sem.

Student Chapter's lead or team cannot be a Campus Mantri.

You need to have permission from your college's principal or Dean and from your HOD with one faculty assigned as a Student Chapter's guide.

Post that you email us with these permission letter and details of the student who is interested in becoming a lead.
We then take a virtual interview to proceed. ‎<This message was edited>

[27/04/24, 7:14:03 PM] ~ Nikhil Sharma: @919354064161 same here ma'am.. I have mailed you.. Would there any kind of support we can expect..
[27/04/24, 8:11:37 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: how can I solve this problem with c++ -- LC biweekly contest problem.
[27/04/24, 8:11:38 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: You are given a 2D matrix grid of size 3 x 3 consisting only of characters 'B' and 'W'. Character 'W' represents the white color, and character 'B' represents the black color.

Your task is to change the color of at most one cell so that the matrix has a 2 x 2 square where all cells are of the same color.
Return true if it is possible to create a 2 x 2 square of the same color, otherwise, return false
[27/04/24, 8:12:45 PM] ~ Revanth: I solved in java using brute force
[27/04/24, 8:13:00 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Input: grid = [["B","W","B"],["B","W","W"],["B","W","B"]]

Output: true

Explanation:

It can be done by changing the color of the grid[0][2]
[27/04/24, 8:13:09 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: here is one testcase
[27/04/24, 8:13:27 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: how i solve this
[27/04/24, 8:13:52 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: what is the flowchart or algo to solve
[27/04/24, 8:15:27 PM] ~ Revanth: There are four 2x2 matrices and count each w frequency and b frequency for each 2x2 matrix.
If for any matrix w==1 or b==1 or w==4 or b==4
Return true
Otherwise false
[27/04/24, 8:39:38 PM] ~ Mohammed Aqib: Just traverse entire grid and check condition just keep in mind loops will terminate 1 step early as you will compare (i,j) , (i+1,j) , (i,j+1) , (i+1,j+1). So if 3 of these 4 have same value for any 2X2 matrix return 1 and if entire loop terminates without returning 1 then return 0

[04/05/24, 6:40:22 PM] ~ Kislay: There are hardly 5+ comment on any post. Don't you think it should be more for 3k followers ac. ‎<This message was edited>
[04/05/24, 6:42:57 PM] ~ Kartik Jain: At least much better than you 607 connections ! and your LinkedIn profile
[04/05/24, 6:43:11 PM] ~ Aadil Latif: And for your knowledge, we can send only 100 connections requests in a week. Overall if we calculate then we can send only 2000 connections requests in 5 months. 

But a twist is coming here that approx 60-75% connection request is accepted by the other side.

So anyone can only increase followers to 1200-1500 in 5 months.

And his followers count is 3000 that is approx double of the connections requests.

Remaining is the result of activeness on his LinkedIn account.
Also, the quality of his post on LinkedIn
[04/05/24, 6:43:19 PM] ~ Kislay: I guess we were talking about genuine followers?
[04/05/24, 6:43:41 PM] ~ Kislay: Yeah that's what I am saying
[04/05/24, 6:44:52 PM] ~ Kartik Jain: Bro genuine follower matlb har post comment nahi hota h aapki post kitni achi h and audience uspar kase react kr rhi h reactions matters and you are not an active linkedin usere that's why you don't know the algorithm of LinkedIn\
[04/05/24, 6:45:26 PM] ~ Kislay: Ok
[04/05/24, 6:45:26 PM] ~ Rahul Purohit: This is more a difference of perspective than anyone being truly wrong
[04/05/24, 6:45:32 PM] ~ Kartik Jain: Yess exactly that's show the quality of post and genuine connctions who react the post and share it
[04/05/24, 6:45:33 PM] ~ Aadil Latif: And if anyone can increase by connection request  then please increase your followers to 4000 till the last month of 2024.
[04/05/24, 6:45:38 PM] ~ Kislay: Kind of
[04/05/24, 6:46:42 PM] ~ Aadil Latif: Sir he has increased his followers by only connection requests.

It is totally wrong ❌, so I am discussing
[04/05/24, 6:48:38 PM] ~ Kislay: No I didn't meant "only by connection request". Maybe it's misunderstanding but my point was the followers which he gained from the random connection request (which maybe only 1k in 5 month as you said) are useless(or not genuine)

[05/05/24, 6:43:06 PM] ~ 😎: DSA
[05/05/24, 6:43:23 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: In DSA I completed Arrays, recursion, binary search and currently doing sorting
[05/05/24, 6:43:44 PM] ~ Naresh M: focus on DEV until you built least 2 good projects for resume and focus on DSA for interviews
[05/05/24, 6:44:15 PM] ~ 😎: bro phale interview hi nahi nileag too dev karke kkya karoge
[05/05/24, 6:44:33 PM] ~ 😎: layoff ka reason yehi smae thing hi

[05/05/24, 6:45:37 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Mein soch rha hu DSA ko side by side continue rakho or Dev pr todha jyada focus karu
[05/05/24, 6:45:56 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Beacuse abhi mujhe dev bilkul bhi nahi aata
[05/05/24, 6:45:58 PM] ~ Naresh M: but if you don't have any good projects the resume won't be shortlisted and we really can't get that opportunity to prove our dsa
[05/05/24, 6:45:59 PM] ~ 😎: but you target 10 + lpa then aapko puri data structure padhni padegi
[05/05/24, 6:46:46 PM] ~ 😎: bro  yehi bande laast me jaake rote hhi ki dsa nahi aati aaur interview nahi nikal raha hi

[05/05/24, 6:47:40 PM] ~ 😎: becasue aap  company me jaane ke baad to nahi sikhogee naa dsa
[05/05/24, 6:47:56 PM] ~ Naresh M: exactly, 3 or 4 months is enough to be able to solve most of the medium question asked in the interviews, right now first focus on creating good projects, where you can use creativity
[05/05/24, 6:48:04 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Mein DSA ki mna nahi kar rha mein keh rha hu ki DSA ko side by side karta rehta hu or Dev bhi start kar deta hu.. jaha DSA ko complete hone mein 6 mahine lagenge wahi 8 mahine or lagenge
[05/05/24, 6:48:13 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: But saath mein dev bhi toh ho jayega

[05/05/24, 6:48:54 PM] ~ 😎: medium level question karne baithi too leetcode ka 5 se 6 hours lagte hi
[05/05/24, 6:49:41 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Haa brother

[05/05/24, 6:50:47 PM] ~ 😎: too phir  naresh bol rhaa hi ki medium kar loge 4 month me sikh ke
[05/05/24, 6:51:27 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: leetcode ka ek medium level questions tha binary search ka  ..
[05/05/24, 6:51:35 PM] ~ 😎: 4 month me easy bhi nahi kar ppaoge
[05/05/24, 6:51:54 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Toh usko O(logn) T.C mein solve karna tha
[05/05/24, 6:52:20 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Mein vs pr code Kiya... Or manually T.C nikali
[05/05/24, 6:52:24 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Toh sahi aa rahi thi

[05/05/24, 6:53:36 PM] ~ Ishu 🇮🇳: Then meine us ko ki chatgpt pr T.C nikali toh udhar bhi uski O(logN) T.C bta rha tha
[05/05/24, 6:57:08 PM] ~ Naresh M: I also think leetcode is not the only thing needed for interviews, generally 
startups : Focus more on Projects
established firms: Focus on Core subjects(DBMS, OS, CN) + DSA + Projects
MAANG: Focus more on DSA + very good projects + some achievements to make your resume stand out + Knowledge in core subject (here don't focus more on learning trending technologies like mern stack but rather the implementation /application matters)
[05/05/24, 9:04:29 PM] ~ Thrisha: guys for salesforce the degree section is filled with BA BS AA GDE and etc...what u ppls gave?
[05/05/24, 9:16:19 PM] ~ ~~宗介   セルバ: Is anyone here selected as mlsa? ‎<This message was edited>
[05/05/24, 9:16:30 PM] ~ 😎: yes
[05/05/24, 9:16:35 PM] ~ 😎: i am mlsa
[05/05/24, 9:16:36 PM] ~ 😎: beta
[05/05/24, 9:16:39 PM] ~ 😎: mlsa
[05/05/24, 9:24:42 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Microsoft student learn ambassador?....
I had been mlsa but my tenure was till March,2024.
[05/05/24, 9:25:24 PM] ~ Naresh M: what do we do as a msla? what are our responsibilities? and is there any perks?
[05/05/24, 9:28:39 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: For beta people they just need to complete learning paths...but if you want to shift to alpha then you have to organise an event (mainly online).

Talking about perks in beta batch you get access to Microsoft Azure and other softwares of Microsoft for free....but as soon as you shift to alpha...you will get goodies from Microsoft and certificate upon completion of your alpha tenure.
[05/05/24, 9:29:31 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Also I had seen one video where the creator was saying that she got a boost in her interview when they asked her about what is alpha MLSA and what did she did as a MLSA and all
[05/05/24, 9:31:24 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: But how do I become a MLSA ?
[05/05/24, 9:31:28 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: I mean, how to start.
[05/05/24, 9:32:10 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: They release form for the same every quarterly ig....just check their website once I think they might have opened it for now. You have to fill the details and submit your resume.
[05/05/24, 9:32:41 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: They filter out mostly on the basis of your resume and online presence (although this one is  minor)
[05/05/24, 9:33:07 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Okay, but what after when we get added to their discord server ?
[05/05/24, 9:33:24 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: What are the tasks before becoming a MLSA ?
[05/05/24, 9:35:16 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Last year, I applied for it and submitter a video of me depicting my qualifications. Then got added to their discord server. But I didn't continue after that as their tasks confused me.
[05/05/24, 9:35:19 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Tasks are assigned only after you are selected as an MLSA.
[05/05/24, 9:36:00 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: But after submitting a video, you get added to a discord server. Right ?
[05/05/24, 9:36:21 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Even there some tasks are assigned I guess.
[05/05/24, 9:36:47 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Maybe I got confused because I don't know to use discord.
[05/05/24, 9:36:50 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: When I had applied for the same they sent me a learning path and asked me to complete it before given deadline. Then after a month I got the confirmation mail that I had been selected as MLSA.
[05/05/24, 9:37:16 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: What is the initial position for MSLA ?
[05/05/24, 9:37:21 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Dw about that. Just check your mail.....all the tasks to be done or learning path to be completed is sent through mail onlu.
[05/05/24, 9:37:22 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Before beta.
[05/05/24, 9:37:49 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Also after you complete the paths they will send you the mail regarding hosting and event to shift to alpha .
[05/05/24, 9:38:00 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Okay, I'll apply for it tomorrow. Is it okay if I text you regarding MLSA application process ?
[05/05/24, 9:40:09 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: For sure. I will be delighted if I can assist you in any way.
[05/05/24, 9:50:54 PM] ~ Pratham Pawar: Okay, thank you buddy.

[06/05/24, 8:25:01 AM] ~ Kstij: Yes I am a beta MLSA , Just go through the website, the forms are always open but they are reviewed quarterly

After successful completion of the task you will become MLSA. If you want to achieve a greater milestone you will have to satisfy the requirements (mentioned on the website)
[06/05/24, 8:29:21 AM] ~ Kstij: You mistakenly wrote the alpha in place of the beta
[06/05/24, 8:34:50 AM] ~ Kstij: As a MLSA all you have to do is conducting event every 3 months and being active in community. You can host both online and offline events. And you can request incentives for the attendee (LinkedIn premium or Xbox game pass). They just need community work. Joining monthly calls. That's it

[06/05/24, 8:36:52 AM] ~ Kstij: Right now I am also a mentor for the MLSA community. So feel free to contact me if you face any doubt again
[06/05/24, 8:41:41 AM] ~ Kstij: Bro can I ask you something?

‎[06/05/24, 8:50:51 AM] ~ Sayan~😁: ‎image omitted
[06/05/24, 8:52:11 AM] ~ Sayan~😁: Form has been released for june and july you can fill up the form
[06/05/24, 9:13:33 AM] ~ Kstij: the tenure is up-to the year of graduation,  till your last sem, How did you ended it in just 4 months? even I am MLSA from last 6 months
[06/05/24, 9:17:42 AM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: No actually within first four months you were suppose to complete the learning path and organise an online event and at that time I was busy with my project so I could actively participate in it. 

Also if you got selected last year during movember then you might have received a mail from them regarding the same on 26 March,2024 .
[06/05/24, 9:17:52 AM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Let me check my mail. If I find it I will share it with you.
[06/05/24, 9:18:54 AM] ~ Aadil Latif: You have half information 
First check the whole information about MLSA
[06/05/24, 9:19:36 AM] ~ Kstij: Yes I  got selected in November, 

as it is necessary to complete learning path and technical onboarding within first four months of getting selected otherwise you will be terminated from that program
[06/05/24, 9:19:58 AM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Exactly that's what I was saying
[06/05/24, 9:20:11 AM] ~ Kstij: and its not possible to be a Beta MLSA before completing Alpha milestone
[06/05/24, 9:20:43 AM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: Brother I along with one of my senior got selected and he was also not able to complete the task since we were engaged in the same project.
[06/05/24, 9:21:45 AM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: That was my fault...I accept it.....but the information was correct though except the level names🙂
[06/05/24, 9:23:06 AM] ~ Kstij: No issue bro, I hope you apply for it again as it is too much helpful
[06/05/24, 9:59:17 AM] ~ 😄: No the path completion continues till next cohort
[06/05/24, 9:59:59 AM] ~ Kstij: elaborate please?
[06/05/24, 10:01:40 AM] ~ 😄: Means suppose you are in influencer path for this cohort and you didn't completed the requirement for it so the views count remains same and you can continue in next cohort
[06/05/24, 10:02:21 AM] ~ Kstij: This step is before becoming MLSA
[06/05/24, 10:02:53 AM] ~ Kstij: as you are referring to above chats of mine, We were taking about steps after becoming MLSA
[06/05/24, 10:04:50 AM] ~ Kstij: On how you will be terminated from program( obviously after getting selected) upon not completing the requirement within first 4 months

[09/05/24, 1:55:19 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: Aditya, it solely depends upon your career goals, 
for GATE you need to get your fundamentals on point, 
that consist of Networking, Operating system and more

DSA & MERN would require a lot of practice along with projects and problem solving
[09/05/24, 1:56:46 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: you can start learning Big Data, understand the importance network security & also ethical hacking and basic fundamentals
[09/05/24, 1:57:50 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: I am a little bit confused because if I prepare for gate now  it would be easy for me because the syllabus is almost similar to the college syllabus.But I want to give a try in the freelance field of web dev
[09/05/24, 1:58:40 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: Dipesh, there is a very classic example of Neet & IITJEE aspirants, 
Despite everyone knowing that there is a big competition. 
still people appear for the exam because that is something which resembles around there dream so, you can choose accordingly, 
more what i suggest to aditya i will suggest the same to you to for Gate Prep
[09/05/24, 2:00:15 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: so, what you can do is 
focus on web dev and techstack of your choice and side by side prepare for the GATE exam because anyway you would be eligible for getting into the Masters degree post your bachelor's getting completed
[09/05/24, 2:00:48 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: that is good,
[09/05/24, 2:01:05 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: what is your approach for this
[09/05/24, 2:03:17 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: you can refer to the GeeksforGeeks youtube channel for the same.
[09/05/24, 2:05:25 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: I will try my best but it's little bit difficult for me to manage both
[09/05/24, 2:06:13 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: Yes!

[23/05/24, 9:55:48 PM] ~ Kstij: for database using Nosql
[23/05/24, 9:57:06 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: Okay! 
More answers
[23/05/24, 10:02:38 PM] ~ Deepak Yadav: It is a NoSQL and open source database which is used for storing large scale of data
[23/05/24, 10:03:11 PM] ~ Ujjwal Mishra: To store structured and unstructured data. Mainly in json format.
[23/05/24, 10:03:48 PM] ~ pulkit: Stores data in schemaless form. In memory level it stores in BSON format
[23/05/24, 10:04:48 PM] ~ Saksham Jain: It is a nosql database, providing easy integration with various technologies, it uses BSON which is similar to JSON which makes it easy to use with javascript apps
[23/05/24, 10:15:46 PM] Kamya Mehra: Basically a nosql db
[23/05/24, 10:42:23 PM] ~ SR: It is used mostly to handle large crowd or load who interact with the servers in large scale..
[23/05/24, 11:00:55 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: Why should someone use MongoDB and not MySql
[23/05/24, 11:04:56 PM] ~ ~Bharath: Mongo db is mostly used in web applications due to real time analysis and stores unstructured data whereas Mysql stores only structured data in relational database. ‎<This message was edited>
[23/05/24, 11:05:05 PM] ~ Malay Jain Modi: it generally depends on our project

if we are working on a real time data which evolves frequently and the data is unstructured
then mongo DB is good

other wise for a structured abd relational data base MySQL

I use MySQL so i don't know much about mongo db ‎<This message was edited>
[23/05/24, 11:05:17 PM] ~ Sai Shankar: Mongodb is horizontally scalable
[23/05/24, 11:05:55 PM] ~ SR: There are a lot of constraints in MySql that are not suitable for server which aims scalability..and MongoDB gives those flexibilities like for example in one collection we can use multiple data types but in sql its not possible and in sql we have to follow ACID properties but in MongoDB these constraints are not there..and there many other advantages..
[23/05/24, 11:08:00 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: 24 people said that they know about mongodb.
Atleast more than half should write something
[23/05/24, 11:14:02 PM] ~ Mukilan 💙: Mongo is faster and flexible..but MySQL is slower because it organise the information in tables. For higher speed mongo is better choice.. and it is beginner friendly to learn..

[27/05/24, 5:25:17 PM] ~ Kislay: Anyone knows any free hosting service provided for hosting backend? It's a light weight backend
[27/05/24, 5:25:33 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: is netlify working.
[27/05/24, 5:25:48 PM] ~ Kislay: Does that support backend? I don't think so
[27/05/24, 5:26:06 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: i'll have to check
[27/05/24, 5:27:45 PM] ~ anush: what language does your backend written in ?
[27/05/24, 5:27:54 PM] ~ Kislay: Nodejs
[27/05/24, 5:29:00 PM] ~ anush: vercel would be the best option then
[27/05/24, 5:29:42 PM] ~ Kislay: Vercel also doesn't support backend hosting
[27/05/24, 5:29:59 PM] ~ Kislay: I am using vercel since 1year for frontend hosting
[27/05/24, 5:31:17 PM] ~ .: It does
[27/05/24, 5:31:43 PM] ~ .: You can use render also
[27/05/24, 5:32:19 PM] ~ Kislay: Render stops if no req sent, it doesn't run 24hrs
[27/05/24, 5:32:31 PM] ~ Kislay: I will try. Thanks for letting me know
[27/05/24, 5:32:39 PM] ~ anush: you can also use aws free tier
[27/05/24, 5:32:46 PM] ~ Aman: Aws
[27/05/24, 5:41:59 PM] ~ Kislay: does it requires credit card?
[27/05/24, 5:43:08 PM] ~ anush: yes, for verification
[27/05/24, 5:45:34 PM] ~ Thiru: render
[27/05/24, 5:45:42 PM] ~ Kislay: ./
[27/05/24, 5:46:14 PM] ~ .: Netlify
[27/05/24, 5:54:19 PM] ~ Shreeti Mohapatra: Render is kinda too much fuss tho, I am trying to deploy backend of an ecommerce website and it's just not happening everytime there is some issue, which is not present when built locally
[27/05/24, 5:55:09 PM] ~ Kislay: Ik fr
[27/05/24, 5:55:40 PM] ~ Shreeti Mohapatra: so even I am searching now
[27/05/24, 5:56:15 PM] ~ Kstij: I think you should go with vercel
[27/05/24, 5:56:15 PM] ~ Shreeti Mohapatra: my frontend is deployed
[27/05/24, 5:56:29 PM] ~ Kstij: As it does support the backend ‎<This message was edited>
[27/05/24, 5:56:34 PM] ~ Shreeti Mohapatra: vercel causes errors sometimes while connecting
[27/05/24, 5:56:54 PM] ~ Kstij: Try adding a custom development script
[27/05/24, 5:57:35 PM] ~ Shreeti Mohapatra: could u tell me a bit more about that ?
[27/05/24, 5:58:06 PM] ~ Shreeti Mohapatra: because honestly I gor frustrated with vercel in backend so I went to render and now it's being too frustrating
[27/05/24, 5:59:37 PM] ~ Kstij: As it uses its own development script in the root folder, sometimes it runs only frontend, try adding path for your backend too, make 3 package, two for frontend and backend in separate folder and one for running the both together concurrently
[27/05/24, 6:00:07 PM] ~ Kstij: I have deployed 2 of my websites with backend and got now issue till now
[27/05/24, 6:07:05 PM] ~ 😄: Can we create a free tier account without credit card?

[29/05/24, 9:11:49 AM] ~ ʀᴏᴄᴋy_ꜱᴀɪ.•°👣🔱: Because it trying to access store at an index that doesn't exist bro.
Thats why its leads to a segmentation fault.
[29/05/24, 9:16:25 AM] ~ Krishna Jadhav: In which case will it try to access the index that doesn't exist
[29/05/24, 9:16:38 AM] ~ Krishna Jadhav: All the edge cases have been handled ig
[29/05/24, 9:27:57 AM] ~ ʀᴏᴄᴋy_ꜱᴀɪ.•°👣🔱: When currnum exceeds the size of the store. 
Store should handle the indices from 0 to n right, so you need to adjust the size of the store as n+1 in place of n.
[29/05/24, 9:35:36 AM] ~ ʀᴏᴄᴋy_ꜱᴀɪ.•°👣🔱: Have you checked the overflow of int_max ?

*If you want to see whether your t-shirt is out for delivery then just download this app called delhivery and login using the same number from which you have registered yourself as campus mantri.. after that you will see if there's any shipment on your name and address... If there's not then don't worry just keep checking everyday as they are dispatching orders regularly to Us after dispatch it will take only 5-6 days to get your tshirt delivered... Hope after this no one will have any confusion and will not keep asking saurabh sir and ma'am.....* ‎<This message was edited>

This project shows how well it's designed and easy for users. It's all built using React.js and just CSS, Designed with the user in mind, seamless and user-friendly interface.

[14/06/24, 10:20:20 AM] ~ Naresh M: It often happens when the size of our single file exceeds the threshold, since you are using react it is straight forward to optimize the code by splitting the bigger file into smaller individual components
[14/06/24, 10:21:00 AM] ~ Kislay: But exactly which file should i work on? I mean should I check all the files?
[14/06/24, 10:21:51 AM] ~ Naresh M: Basically you can look into the size of all files and pick the one that oddly has a higher sizer than other files.
[14/06/24, 10:22:30 AM] ~ Naresh M: Doing this in file explorer is straightforward, than in vs code

[18/06/24, 11:35:41 AM] ~ Kavya Gupta: Pr jaise c = 2147483600 h aur sqrt nikalenge to aayega approx 46000 aur jab j*j karenge tb vo int ki range me hi aa raha h

Data Science 
Machine learning 
Or Software Development

## Introduction

The Attendance Portal Website project aims to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for managing attendance records in an educational institution. This web-based system will serve various user roles, including administrators, faculty members, students, the Dean, and Heads of Departments (HODs). The system will allow for efficient attendance recording, data management, and communication between different stakeholders.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Automated Attendance Management:** Develop an automated attendance tracking system to streamline the process of recording and managing attendance for students.

2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive web interface for easy login, attendance tracking, and data retrieval by various users.

3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the system.

4. **Data Security:** Prioritize the security of sensitive data, including personal information, attendance records, and user credentials.

5. **Efficient Communication:** Enable efficient communication between faculty, students, and administrative personnel for attendance-related matters.

6. **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to keep users informed about updates, notices, and important events.

## Project Components

The project will consist of the following key components:

### 1. 0-Level Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
- An overview of the system and its main stakeholders.

### 2. User Roles
- Administrator, Dean, HODs, Faculty, and Students, each with specific permissions and actions.

[02/07/24, 8:21:21 PM] ~ Naresh M: If you can afford a little amount I will recommend RBR sir's DSA course.
[02/07/24, 8:31:31 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: Can someone suggest me what to do now 

Mern 

Or DSA

I have basic knowledge of both I am bit confused what to do should I practice more of DP and Graph or should I continue mern to get an internship
[02/07/24, 8:34:33 PM] ~ Vipul Kumar: which sem you are currently?\
[02/07/24, 8:34:52 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: Currently I will go in 5th sem
[02/07/24, 8:35:08 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: Summer breaks are going on
[02/07/24, 8:35:37 PM] ~ Vipul Kumar: then you need to focus on both dsa(60%) and mern (40%)
[02/07/24, 8:37:06 PM] ~ Aditya Srivastava: Have tried to manage both but not getting the motivation to continue with the dev part
[02/07/24, 8:38:53 PM] ~ Vipul Kumar: bro if you want to take placement / internship then you have to do consistent word and there is no any motivation if you don't want from your heart.
[02/07/24, 8:49:15 PM] ~ Naresh M: I will share my opinion, most of the people are trying to learn new trending tech stacks, but let me tell you that will not a good option for you now, why? See learning these tech stacks doesn't require any special background knowledge and any one can learn it, and as a fresher when joining a company literally no product based company questions you on tech stacks, so just drop that idea unless you want to get into service based jobs and get underpaid,

focus on only two things now as a CS student,

1. DSA 
2. learn core subjects (CN, C programming, Digital Logic, DBMS, OS, CD, TOC)
This will be make you interview ready when you get into your final year, you don't need tech stacks and if you wonder what about projects that is secondary, you can do them in the last 2 or 3 months when you are ready

[23/10/24, 6:44:40 PM] Aman Sir Gfg Interview: *Hello Mantri's,* 

Hope you are doing well and are excited about the coming festival.

It has come to my notice that even after providing a learning opportunity majority of you have not started the course and have not even logged in.

This is very appalling that from our end we are trying to put best of things for you and it seem that no one is interested a bit.

To remind you only have access for a few days and would suggest if you can utilise the resources given in best possible way.


 *Regards*

[25/10/24, 11:00:45 PM] ~ Sai Shankar: Help Us Shape the Future of Coding Collaboration!

Hi everyone! We’re excited to announce that we’re building a Collaborative IDE designed to make real-time coding, sharing, and teamwork easier than ever. To ensure we’re addressing real developer needs, we’re conducting a quick survey to learn about your current collaboration tools and what you wish could be better!

If you’re someone who codes, collaborates, or just loves to try new tech, we’d love your input. The survey only takes a few minutes, and your feedback will be invaluable in helping us create a tool that’s truly user-centered.

https://forms.gle/LapNpWYiH5p9piya7

Thank you for helping us make something great for the developer community!
