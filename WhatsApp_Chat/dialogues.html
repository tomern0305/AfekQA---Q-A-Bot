But I didn't continue after that as their tasks confused me.<hr>09:35:19 Ujjwal Mishra: Tasks are assigned only after you are selected as an MLSA.<hr>09:36:00 Pratham Pawar: But after submitting a video, you get added to a discord server. Right ?<hr>09:36:21 Pratham Pawar: Even there some tasks are assigned I guess.<hr>09:36:47 Pratham Pawar: Maybe I got confused because I don't know to use discord.<hr>09:36:50 Ujjwal Mishra: When I had applied for the same they sent me a learning path and asked me to complete it before given deadline. Then after a month I got the confirmation mail that I had been selected as MLSA.<hr>09:37:16 Pratham Pawar: What is the initial position for MSLA ?<hr>09:37:21 Ujjwal Mishra: Dw about that. Just check your mail.....all the tasks to be done or learning path to be completed is sent through mail onlu.<hr>09:37:22 Pratham Pawar: Before beta.<hr>09:37:49 Ujjwal Mishra: Also after you complete the paths they will send you the mail regarding hosting and event to shift to alpha .<hr>09:38:00 Pratham Pawar: Okay, I'll apply for it tomorrow.

This web-based system will serve various user roles, including administrators, faculty members, students, the Dean, and Heads of Departments (HODs). The system will allow for efficient attendance recording, data management, and communication between different stakeholders.<br><br>## Project Objectives<br><br>The primary objectives of this project are as follows:<br><br>1. **Automated Attendance Management:** Develop an automated attendance tracking system to streamline the process of recording and managing attendance for students.<br><br>2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive web interface for easy login, attendance tracking, and data retrieval by various users.<br><br>3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the system.<br><br>4. **Data Security:** Prioritize the security of sensitive data, including personal information, attendance records, and user credentials.<br><br>5. **Efficient Communication:** Enable efficient communication between faculty, students, and administrative personnel for attendance-related matters.<br><br>6. **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to keep users informed about updates, notices, and important events.<br><br>## Project Components<br><br>The project will consist of the following key components:<br><br>### 1. 0-Level Data Flow Diagram (DFD)<br>- An overview of the system and its main stakeholders.<br><br>### 2. User Roles<br>- Administrator, Dean, HODs, Faculty, and Students, each with specific permissions and actions.<br><br>### 3. Administrative Portal<br>- Allows administrators to manage user accounts, handle requests, and monitor system operations.<br><br>### 4. HOD Portal<br>- Enables HODs to manage faculty, assign subjects, and view departmental attendance data.<br><br>### 5. Faculty Portal<br>- Allows faculty to take attendance, view assigned subjects, and communicate with students.<br><br>### 6. Dean Portal<br>- Provides access to Deans for viewing all assigned subjects, managing attendance, and personal information.<br><br>### 7. Student Portal<br>- Enables students to view attendance data, subject information, and receive notifications.<br><br>### 8. Database Management<br>- Backend databases for storing user data, attendance records, and communication data.<br><br>### 9. Notification System<br>- An integrated notification system for sending and receiving important updates.<br><br>## Methodology<br><br>We will follow the Agile project management methodology to ensure flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. Regular meetings and feedback sessions with stakeholders will be held to incorporate changes and updates as needed.<br><br>## Timeline<br><br>The project will be divided into phases, each with its deliverables and timelines:<br><br>- Phase 1: Requirement Analysis and System Design (Month 1-2)<br>- Phase 2: Development and Testing (Month 3-6)<br>- Phase 3: User Training and Pilot Testing (Month 7-8)<br>- Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance (Month 9 onwards)<br><br>## Budget<br><br>The estimated budget for this project includes costs for development, testing, hardware, software licenses, and maintenance. A detailed budget breakdown will be provided in the project plan.<br><br>## Conclusion<br><br>The Attendance Portal Website project is a crucial system for the efficient management of attendance records in our educational institution. We believe that by implementing this system, we will improve data accuracy, enhance communication, and simplify administrative tasks related to attendance. We look forward to your approval and support for the successful execution of this project.<br><br>If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.<br><br>---<br><br>This project proposal outlines the objectives, components, methodology, timeline, and budget for the Attendance Portal Website project. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements and expectations.<hr>11:04:37 Shivam: If you have experience in ML, you can go with Visual to Text  like thing<hr>11:06:00 Aditya Gaur: If any one here do competitive programming, please share your codeforces profile link I want to know something<hr>11:06:32 Nikhil Sharma: Basically working with web3 and have little bit of experience in html css javascript..
