I have mailed you.. Would there any kind of support we can expect..\nuser1045: how can I solve this problem with c++ -- LC biweekly contest problem.\nuser1045: You are given a 2D matrix grid of size 3 x 3 consisting only of characters 'B' and 'W'. Character 'W' represents the white color, and character 'B' represents the black color.\n\nYour task is to change the color of at most one cell so that the matrix has a 2 x 2 square where all cells are of the same color.\nReturn true if it is possible to create a 2 x 2 square of the same color, otherwise, return false\nuser1021: I solved in java using brute force\nuser1045: Input: grid = [[\"B\",\"W\",\"B\"],[\"B\",\"W\",\"W\"],[\"B\",\"W\",\"B\"]]\n\nOutput: true\n\nExplanation:\n\nIt can be done by changing the color of the grid[0][2]\nuser1045: here is one testcase\nuser1045: how i solve this\nuser1045: what is the flowchart or algo to solve\nuser1021: There are four 2x2 matrices and count each w frequency and b frequency for each 2x2 matrix.\nIf for any matrix w==1 or b==1 or w==4 or b==4\nReturn true\nOtherwise false\nuser1057: Just traverse entire grid and check condition just keep in mind loops will terminate 1 step early as you will compare (i,j) , (i+1,j) , (i,j+1) , (i+1,j+1). So if 3 of these 4 have same value for any 2X2 matrix return 1 and if entire loop terminates without returning 1 then return 0\nuser1015: POLL:\nDid all the people who said yes like this idea?

You have to fill the details and submit your resume.\nuser1041: They filter out mostly on the basis of your resume and online presence (although this one is  minor)\nuser1005: Okay, but what after when we get added to their discord server ?\nuser1005: What are the tasks before becoming a MLSA ?\nuser1005: Last year, I applied for it and submitter a video of me depicting my qualifications. Then got added to their discord server. But I didn't continue after that as their tasks confused me.\nuser1041: Tasks are assigned only after you are selected as an MLSA.\nuser1005: But after submitting a video, you get added to a discord server. Right ?\nuser1005: Even there some tasks are assigned I guess.\nuser1005: Maybe I got confused because I don't know to use discord.\nuser1041: When I had applied for the same they sent me a learning path and asked me to complete it before given deadline. Then after a month I got the confirmation mail that I had been selected as MLSA.\nuser1005: What is the initial position for MSLA ?\nuser1041: Dw about that. Just check your mail.....all the tasks to be done or learning path to be completed is sent through mail onlu.\nuser1005: Before beta.\nuser1041: Also after you complete the paths they will send you the mail regarding hosting and event to shift to alpha .\nuser1005: Okay, I'll apply for it tomorrow. Is it okay if I text you regarding MLSA application process ?\nuser1041: For sure.

This web-based system will serve various user roles, including administrators, faculty members, students, the Dean, and Heads of Departments (HODs). The system will allow for efficient attendance recording, data management, and communication between different stakeholders.\n\n## Project Objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of this project are as follows:\n\n1. **Automated Attendance Management:** Develop an automated attendance tracking system to streamline the process of recording and managing attendance for students.\n\n2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive web interface for easy login, attendance tracking, and data retrieval by various users.\n\n3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the system.\n\n4. **Data Security:** Prioritize the security of sensitive data, including personal information, attendance records, and user credentials.\n\n5. **Efficient Communication:** Enable efficient communication between faculty, students, and administrative personnel for attendance-related matters.\n\n6. **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to keep users informed about updates, notices, and important events.\n\n## Project Components\n\nThe project will consist of the following key components:\n\n### 1. 0-Level Data Flow Diagram (DFD)\n- An overview of the system and its main stakeholders.\n\n### 2. User Roles\n- Administrator, Dean, HODs, Faculty, and Students, each with specific permissions and actions.\n\n### 3. Administrative Portal\n- Allows administrators to manage user accounts, handle requests, and monitor system operations.\n\n### 4. HOD Portal\n- Enables HODs to manage faculty, assign subjects, and view departmental attendance data.\n\n### 5. Faculty Portal\n- Allows faculty to take attendance, view assigned subjects, and communicate with students.\n\n### 6. Dean Portal\n- Provides access to Deans for viewing all assigned subjects, managing attendance, and personal information.\n\n### 7. Student Portal\n- Enables students to view attendance data, subject information, and receive notifications.\n\n### 8. Database Management\n- Backend databases for storing user data, attendance records, and communication data.\n\n### 9. Notification System\n- An integrated notification system for sending and receiving important updates.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe will follow the Agile project management methodology to ensure flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. Regular meetings and feedback sessions with stakeholders will be held to incorporate changes and updates as needed.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe project will be divided into phases, each with its deliverables and timelines:\n\n- Phase 1: Requirement Analysis and System Design (Month 1-2)\n- Phase 2: Development and Testing (Month 3-6)\n- Phase 3: User Training and Pilot Testing (Month 7-8)\n- Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance (Month 9 onwards)\n\n## Budget\n\nThe estimated budget for this project includes costs for development, testing, hardware, software licenses, and maintenance. A detailed budget breakdown will be provided in the project plan.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Attendance Portal Website project is a crucial system for the efficient management of attendance records in our educational institution. We believe that by implementing this system, we will improve data accuracy, enhance communication, and simplify administrative tasks related to attendance. We look forward to your approval and support for the successful execution of this project.\n\nIf you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\n---\n\nThis project proposal outlines the objectives, components, methodology, timeline, and budget for the Attendance Portal Website project. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements and expectations.\nuser1023: If you have experience in ML, you can go with Visual to Text  like thing\nuser1142: If any one here do competitive programming, please share your codeforces profile link I want to know something\nuser1140: Basically working with web3 and have little bit of experience in html css javascript..
