# üìö Afeka College RAG Bot

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) and **OpenAI Chat Models**.  
It is designed to **answer questions about Afeka College** by combining structured data (PDF files, WhatsApp messages) and unstructured knowledge scraped from the Afeka website.  
The bot communicates with users through **Telegram** (primary interface) and has also been tested with **WhatsApp message datasets**.

## üöÄ Features
- **RAG architecture**: Uses OpenAI embeddings with a Pinecone vector database to retrieve and ground responses.
- **Multi-source ingestion**:  
  - Workflow for **PDF files** (official documents, course guides).  
  - Workflow for **WhatsApp JSON exports** (student group discussions, FAQs).  
- **Messaging integration**:  
  - **Telegram bot** for interactive question answering.  
  - Future extension for WhatsApp live messaging.  
- **Preprocessing notebook**: Cleans and normalizes WhatsApp chat logs into a format suitable for ingestion.
- **Contextual memory**: Maintains short-term conversational context with buffer memory.
- **Visual workflows**: Included `.png` diagrams for each workflow.

- ## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflows Overview

### 1. Agent Workflow (Telegram RAG Bot)
- **Trigger**: Telegram messages  
- **Steps**:  
  - Parses incoming text  
  - Queries Pinecone vector DB  
  - Sends response through OpenAI Chat (`gpt-4.1-mini`)  
  - Replies back to the user via Telegram
