# 📚 Afeka College RAG Bot

This project, which **🏆 won 1st place at Afeka College’s Hackathon (2025)**, is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/) and **OpenAI Chat Models**.  
It is designed to **answer questions about Afeka College** by combining structured data (PDF files, WhatsApp messages) and unstructured knowledge scraped from the Afeka website.  
The bot communicates with users through **Telegram** (primary interface) and has also been tested with **WhatsApp message datasets**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **RAG architecture**: Uses OpenAI embeddings with a Pinecone vector database to retrieve and ground responses.
- **Multi-source ingestion**:  
  - Workflow for **PDF files** (official documents, course guides).  
  - Workflow for **WhatsApp JSON exports** (student group discussions, FAQs).  
- **Messaging integration**:  
  - **Telegram bot** for interactive question answering.  
  - Future extension for WhatsApp live messaging.  
- **Preprocessing notebook**: Cleans and normalizes WhatsApp chat logs into a format suitable for ingestion.
- **Contextual memory**: Maintains short-term conversational context with buffer memory.
- **Visual workflows**: Included `.png` diagrams for each workflow.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Students get instant answers about academic regulations, courses, and procedures.
- Academic staff saves time by focusing on more complex student needs.
- College community benefits from faster and more accessible information.
